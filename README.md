# wStateSession [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Wandalen/wStateSession.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Wandalen/wStateSession)

Mixin to add persistent session storing functionality to a class. StateSession extends StateStorage. These modules solve the common problem to persistently store the state( session ) of an object. Them let save the state in a specific moment ( for example on process exit ) and to restore the state later ( for example on process start ). Use the module to be more cross-platform, don't repeat yourself and forget about details of implementation you don't worry.

## Try out
```
npm install
node sample/Sample.s
```
